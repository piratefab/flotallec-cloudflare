### What happened to ChatSecure Android?

The developers of the Android version have [hard forked the code](https://github.com/zom/Zom-Android) and are no longer maintaining the upstream version. If you still use ChatSecure Android you should migrate to another app immediately. For a similar user experience and the best compatibility with the latest features of ChatSecure iOS, we recommend downloading [Conversations](https://conversations.im).

The development of ChatSecure iOS is unaffected by this change and we will continue to release new features and updates.
