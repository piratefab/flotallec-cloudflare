## Libraries

These free and open source libraries may be useful for other developers wishing to develop privacy-enhancing technologies. 

### OTRKit

[OTRKit](https://github.com/ChatSecure/OTRKit) is an Objective-C wrapper for the OTRv3 encrypted messaging protocol, using libotr. This library was designed for use with ChatSecure, but should theoretically work for Mac OS X as well with some minor tweaking to the build scripts.
